# PhysiCode Academy: An Introduction to Physics through Programming

Welcome to PhysiCode Academy, an educational project developed to combine the power of programming with the fundamentals of physics.

## About the Project:

This repository aims to provide an engaging introduction to physics for high school students and science enthusiasts. 
By combining the knowledge acquired so far in my Engineering Physics degree and my programming skills in Bash and Python, I believe this educational application offers a practical and interactive approach to understanding physics concepts and introducing programming to our young students as early as possible.

## What to Expect:

- Interactive examples demonstrating physics principles using Python.
- Utilization of Bash Script for interaction by terminal, integrating its application with the Python language.
- Graphs and visualizations making physical phenomena more understandable and intriguing.
- Context-based exercises and problems to practice what has been learned.
- And of course, all contributions are welcome! Feel free to add new topics, improvements, and corrections.

## About the Author:

Hello, my name is Alison. I am a physics and mathematics teacher for primary and secondary education, and IÂ´m currently pursuing a Scientific Initiation Scholarship at CTA-UFRGS, 
deepening my knowledge in Bash and Python programming. We can say that PhysiCode Academy is the result of my passion for teaching and sharing the fascination for physics while merging it 
with programming, which is highly relevant nowadays. I believe that this project can ignite the curiosity and interest of students and enthusiasts in science and programming. 
Welcome to this journey of discoveries, LET'S CODE!
